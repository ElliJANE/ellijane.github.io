                <h1>Falling For Eve</h1>
                <h2>Original Script and Lyrics by David Howard</h2>
                <p>Featuring music by Bret Simmons and lyrics by David Howard, the show offers an unconventional retelling of the story of Adam and Eve, filled with unexpected twists and turns.
                    </p>
                    <p>Creation is going exactly according to plan: Eve, curious about what lies beyond the garden, and positively perplexed with the idea of something that's forbidden, eats the apple.  Then Adam… doesn't.  Eden, we have a problem.  How exactly God is going to get his children together so they can create the human race is anybody's guess.  At times hilarious, at times poignant, <em>Falling for Eve</em> is an unconventional retelling of the world's first love story.  Filled with unexpected twists and turns, the first couple doesn't get to happily ever after until they finally realize that paradise isn't a place at all.  As Adam ultimately tells Eve, “Paradise is You.”
